Great question! While security is a major reason, there are several other important reasons why String is immutable in Java. Here's a complete explanation:
âœ… 1. Caching and Performance (String Pooling)
Java stores string literals in a string pool to reuse objects and save memory.
Immutability allows strings to be shared safely across the JVM without risk of modification.

ðŸ”¸ Example:

String a = "hello";
String b = "hello"; // 'b' points to the same object as 'a'
If strings were mutable, changing a would affect b â€” which breaks the concept of sharing.

âœ… 2. Thread Safety
Since String objects can't be changed, they are inherently thread-safe.
Multiple threads can access a string without synchronization, improving performance.

âœ… 3. Reliable HashCode (Used in HashMap, HashSet)
Strings are often used as keys in hash-based collections like HashMap.

Immutability ensures the hash code remains constant, so:

The key doesn't "disappear"

The map stays consistent

âœ… 4. Safe for Class Loading and Configuration
Class loading, file paths, and config values (like DB URLs, usernames) are passed as strings.

If someone could modify those strings after they're created, it could lead to bugs or even security issues â€” immutability prevents that.

âœ… 5. Predictable Behavior in Programs
Immutability ensures strings behave consistently. You donâ€™t have to worry about side effects â€” if a method gets a string, you know it wonâ€™t change it accidentally.

âœ… Summary:
| Reason           | Benefit                           |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------- |
| String Pooling   | Memory efficiency                 |
| Thread Safety    | No need for synchronization       |
| Stable HashCode  | Safe for maps and sets            |
| Secure Usage     | For classpaths, credentials, etc. |
| Predictable Code | No unexpected side effects        |
