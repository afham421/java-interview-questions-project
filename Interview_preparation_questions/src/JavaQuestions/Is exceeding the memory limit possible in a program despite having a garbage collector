Yes, absolutely. Even though Java has a Garbage Collector (GC) to manage memory automatically, it is still possible to exceed the memory limit and run into an OutOfMemoryError.

âœ… Why Can Memory Be Exceeded Even With GC?
ðŸ”¹ 1. Memory Leaks
If objects are still referenced, GC wonâ€™t collect them, even if they're no longer needed.

This causes memory to fill up over time.

ðŸ”¹ 2. Too Much Data Loaded
If your program tries to load/process very large files, collections, or data from a DB, you might exceed the heap space.

ðŸ”¹ 3. Infinite Object Creation
Poorly written code (e.g., creating objects in a loop without releasing them) can quickly exhaust memory.

ðŸ”¹ 4. Incorrect JVM Settings
If heap size (-Xmx, -Xms) is set too low, the app may run out of memory even if GC is working.

ðŸ”¹ 5. GC Can't Keep Up
If your app creates objects faster than GC can collect them, memory fills up eventually.

ðŸ§  Example:
java
Copy
Edit
List<int[]> memoryLeak = new ArrayList<>();
while (true) {
    memoryLeak.add(new int[1000000]); // Keep allocating
}
This will eventually throw:

makefile
Copy
Edit
java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space
âœ… Summary:
"Yes, exceeding memory is possible even with a garbage collector. GC only reclaims memory from unreachable objects.
If your program holds references too long or allocates more than GC can clean, memory will eventually run out."
