//"JAR hell" is a term used to describe the problems that arise when dealing with multiple JAR (Java Archive) files in a Java application,
// particularly when there are conflicts or issues due to incompatible or duplicate libraries.
// These issues can lead to various runtime errors and inconsistencies in Java applications.

//Common Causes of JAR Hell
//Duplicate Classes: Multiple JAR files contain the same class, which can cause conflicts. Java might load the wrong version of the class or have difficulty resolving which class to use.
//Version Conflicts: Different JAR files may depend on different versions of the same library. This can lead to conflicts if the application expects one version but another is provided.
//Classpath Issues: An application might have a complex classpath with many JAR files, leading to ambiguity about which classes should be loaded, especially if there are conflicting classes or packages.
//Transitive Dependencies: Libraries often have dependencies on other libraries. If these transitive dependencies conflict with each other or with other libraries in your classpath, it can create issues.

//Symptoms of JAR Hell
//ClassNotFoundException: When the JVM cannot find a class that was expected to be available.
//NoClassDefFoundError: When a class is found at compile-time but not available at runtime.
//ClassCastException: When a class loaded from one JAR cannot be cast to another class because they are loaded from different JARs with conflicting versions.
//Inconsistent Behavior: When an application behaves differently depending on the order of JARs in the classpath or the environment.

//Strategies to Avoid JAR Hell
//Dependency Management: Use dependency management tools like Maven or Gradle. These tools handle transitive dependencies and ensure that the correct versions of libraries are used.
// They also avoid including multiple versions of the same library.

//ClassLoader Isolation: Use separate class loaders to isolate different parts of an application, especially in complex environments like application servers or OSGi containers.
//Modularization: Break down large applications into smaller modules to reduce the complexity of the classpath and make it easier to manage dependencies.
//Fat JARs: Package dependencies into a single JAR file (often called a "fat JAR" or "uber JAR") to avoid classpath issues, though this can be problematic if not managed carefully.
//Testing: Test the application thoroughly with the complete classpath setup to catch any issues related to JAR conflicts early in the development process.
