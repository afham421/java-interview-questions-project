✅ Why is it said that String.length() may not return accurate results?
The length() method in Java returns the number of char units in a String, not necessarily the number of visible characters (user-perceived characters).

🔍 Reason: Unicode and UTF-16 Encoding
Java String uses UTF-16 encoding, where:

Most characters = 1 char (2 bytes)

But some special characters (like emojis, accented characters, or rare scripts) = 2 char values, called surrogate pairs

⚠️ Example:
java
Copy
Edit
String str = "😊"; // emoji
System.out.println(str.length()); // Output: 2
Even though "😊" looks like 1 character, length() returns 2 because it's encoded as two char values.

✅ So when is it “inaccurate”?
length() = number of char code units

❌ Not always equal to the number of visible characters (aka grapheme count)

✅ Solution for Accurate Character Count:
If you want the actual number of characters, use:

java
Copy
Edit
int count = str.codePointCount(0, str.length());
System.out.println(count); // Output: 1 for "😊"
✅ Summary:
"String.length() returns the number of 16-bit char units, not true visible characters. Due to Unicode surrogate pairs, some characters (like emojis) take 2 units, making the result seem inaccurate."
