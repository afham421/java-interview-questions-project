âœ… What is a ClassLoader in Java?
A ClassLoader in Java is a part of the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) that loads .class files into memory when a Java program runs.

In simple terms:
It loads Java classes into the JVM when needed.

ðŸ“¦ Why is it needed?
Java uses dynamic class loading, meaning classes are loaded into memory only when required, not all at once.
The ClassLoader handles this process automatically behind the scenes.
