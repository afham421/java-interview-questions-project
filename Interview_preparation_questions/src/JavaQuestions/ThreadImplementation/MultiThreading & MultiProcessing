Differences Between Multithreading and Multiprocessing:

Feature	                    Multithreading                                                                           	Multiprocessing
Memory Sharing	                    Shared memory space among threads                                           	Separate memory space for each process
Communication	                    Easier communication between threads                                 	Requires inter-process communication (IPC) mechanisms
Overhead	                    Lower overhead, more lightweight	                                     Higher overhead, heavier due to separate memory allocation
Context                     Switching	Faster context switching	                                              Slower context switching
Suitability	                    I/O-bound tasks	                                                                          CPU-bound tasks
Risk of Deadlock                    	Higher risk of deadlock due to shared memory                                            	Lower risk of deadlock
