In Java, synchronization is used to control the access of multiple threads to shared resources.
 It ensures that only one thread can access the synchronized block or method at a time, preventing thread interference and data inconsistency.

You can synchronize a method or block of code like this:

Synchronized Method:


public synchronized void syncMethod() {
    // critical section
}
Synchronized Block:


public void method() {
    synchronized(this) {
        // critical section
    }
}
In the synchronized block, this refers to the current object; you can also lock on other objects.
