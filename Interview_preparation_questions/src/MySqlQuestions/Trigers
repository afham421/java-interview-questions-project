Triggers in a relational database are special kinds of stored procedures that are automatically executed (or "triggered") in response to certain events on a particular table or view.
Triggers are typically used to enforce business rules, validate data, maintain audit trails, and synchronize tables.

Types of Triggers
There are several types of triggers, each designed to respond to different types of events:

Before Triggers:
Executed before the triggering event (such as an INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE) occurs.
Often used to validate data before it is committed to the database.

CREATE TRIGGER BeforeEmployeeInsert
BEFORE INSERT ON Employees
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    IF NEW.Salary < 0 THEN
        SIGNAL SQLSTATE '45000'
        SET MESSAGE_TEXT = 'Salary cannot be negative';
    END IF;
END;
Explanation:
    This trigger checks if the Salary value being inserted into the Employees table is negative. If it is, an error is raised, preventing the insertion.

After Triggers:
Executed after the triggering event has occurred.
Commonly used for logging, auditing, or updating related tables.

CREATE TRIGGER AfterEmployeeInsert
AFTER INSERT ON Employees
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO EmployeeAudit (EmployeeID, Action, ActionDate)
    VALUES (NEW.EmployeeID, 'INSERT', NOW());
END;
Explanation:
This trigger logs every new employee added to the Employees table into an EmployeeAudit table, capturing the EmployeeID, the action taken (INSERT), and the date the action occurred.

Instead Of Triggers:
Used primarily with views, INSTEAD OF triggers replace the standard action of the triggering event.
 For example, instead of directly performing an INSERT on a view, the trigger can insert data into the underlying tables.

 CREATE TRIGGER InsteadOfInsertOnEmployeeView
 INSTEAD OF INSERT ON EmployeeView
 FOR EACH ROW
 BEGIN
     INSERT INTO Employees (EmployeeID, FullName)
     VALUES (NEW.EmployeeID, NEW.FullName);

     INSERT INTO Salaries (EmployeeID, Salary)
     VALUES (NEW.EmployeeID, NEW.Salary);
 END;
Explanation:
In the INSTEAD OF trigger you've provided, the data is inserted into the Employees and Salaries tables, not directly into the EmployeeView.
The trigger does not insert data into the EmployeeView itself; it redirects the insertion to the underlying Employees and Salaries tables.
