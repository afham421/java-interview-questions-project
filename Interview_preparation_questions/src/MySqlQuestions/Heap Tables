Heap tables (also known as Memory tables) in MySQL are tables that store data in memory rather than on disk.
 This makes them very fast for read and write operations, but the data is temporary and lost if the server crashes or is restarted.

Key Features:
Storage Engine: Use the MEMORY storage engine.
Speed: Extremely fast due to data being stored in RAM.
Volatile: Data is not persisted to disk.
Table Locking: Uses table-level locking, not row-level locking.
No BLOB/TEXT: Does not support BLOB or TEXT data types because of memory limitations.

Usage: Best for temporary or session-based data.

Example:
CREATE TABLE my_heap_table (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100)
) ENGINE=MEMORY;

Heap tables are ideal for quick lookups and temporary data storage where persistence is not required.
