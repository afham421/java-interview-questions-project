The CONCAT function in SQL is used to combine (concatenate) two or more strings into one string.

Syntax:

CONCAT(string1, string2, ..., stringN)
Example:

SELECT CONCAT(first_name, ' ', last_name) AS full_name
FROM employees;
This would combine the first_name and last_name fields into a single full_name column with a space in between.

Notes:
If any argument is NULL, CONCAT returns the result as NULL in some databases. In MySQL, however, CONCAT treats NULL as an empty string.
