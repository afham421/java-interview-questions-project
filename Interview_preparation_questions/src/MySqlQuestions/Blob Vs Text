In MySQL, both BLOB (Binary Large Object) and TEXT are data types used to store large amounts of data, but they serve different purposes
and are optimized for different kinds of data. Here's a comparison between the two:

1. BLOB (Binary Large Object)
Purpose: Used to store binary data, such as images, videos, audio files, and other types of multimedia content.
Storage: Stores data as-is, meaning it doesn’t perform any character set conversion or interpretation. Data is stored in a binary format.

Variants:
TINYBLOB: Up to 255 bytes.
BLOB: Up to 65,535 bytes (64 KB).
MEDIUMBLOB: Up to 16,777,215 bytes (16 MB).
LONGBLOB: Up to 4,294,967,295 bytes (4 GB).
Use Cases: Suitable for storing non-textual data like binary files, encrypted data, or any data where character encoding should not be applied.

2. TEXT
Purpose: Used to store large amounts of textual data, such as long articles, descriptions, or JSON strings.
Storage: Stores data as text and performs character set conversion based on the database’s or column’s character set and collation.
Variants:
TINYTEXT: Up to 255 bytes.
TEXT: Up to 65,535 bytes (64 KB).
MEDIUMTEXT: Up to 16,777,215 bytes (16 MB).
LONGTEXT: Up to 4,294,967,295 bytes (4 GB).
Use Cases: Ideal for storing large amounts of text that might include characters, HTML, or XML, where proper encoding and collation are necessary.

Key Differences

Data Type:
BLOB: Stores binary data (raw bytes).
TEXT: Stores text data (characters).

Character Set and Collation:
BLOB: Does not use character sets or collation; it’s treated as binary data.
TEXT: Uses character sets and collation; it’s treated as textual data.

Use Cases:
BLOB: Use when storing non-textual data (e.g., images, videos, audio).
TEXT: Use when storing textual data (e.g., articles, JSON, XML).

Operations:
BLOB: Suitable for operations that involve binary data, like storing files or encrypted content.
TEXT: Suitable for operations involving textual data, such as searching within the text, applying string functions, and considering case sensitivity based on collation.

Summary
Use BLOB when you need to store binary data like multimedia files or encrypted data.
Use TEXT when you need to store large amounts of textual data where character encoding and collation are important.
