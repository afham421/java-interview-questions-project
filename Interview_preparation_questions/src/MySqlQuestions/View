In MySQL, a view is a virtual table that is defined by a query. It allows you to encapsulate complex queries, simplify your database interactions,
and present data in a specific format without altering the actual data in the tables.

Creating a View
To create a view, you use the CREATE VIEW statement. Hereâ€™s the basic syntax:

CREATE VIEW view_name AS
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;

Example
Suppose you have a table called employees and you want to create a view that shows only employees from a specific department:

CREATE VIEW department_employees AS
SELECT employee_id, first_name, last_name, department
FROM employees
WHERE department = 'Sales';


Querying a View
You can query a view just like you would a regular table:

SELECT * FROM department_employees;
