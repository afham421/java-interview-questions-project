In MySQL, UNION and UNION ALL are used to combine the results of two or more SELECT queries into a single result set. While they are similar, there are key differences between them:

1. UNION
Combines the results of two or more SELECT statements and removes duplicate rows from the final result set.
By default, it performs a DISTINCT operation to eliminate any duplicate records.
Since it removes duplicates, it may be slower compared to UNION ALL, especially with large datasets.
Example:
SELECT first_name FROM employees
UNION
SELECT first_name FROM customers;

Explanation: This query returns a list of unique first names from both the employees and customers tables. If a first name appears in both tables, it will only appear once in the result set.

2. UNION ALL
Combines the results of two or more SELECT statements and includes all rows, including duplicates.
It does not perform a DISTINCT operation, so it is generally faster than UNION.
Useful when you want to include duplicates or when you know that the result sets being combined do not have any overlapping rows.
Example:
SELECT first_name FROM employees
UNION ALL
SELECT first_name FROM customers;

Explanation: This query returns all first names from both the employees and customers tables, including any duplicates. If a first name appears in both tables, it will appear twice in the result set.

Performance Considerations
UNION: The process of removing duplicates (using DISTINCT) adds an extra step, which can impact performance, especially with large datasets.
UNION ALL: Since it doesnâ€™t remove duplicates, it performs faster and is more efficient when duplicates are not a concern.


Summary
UNION: Combines result sets and removes duplicates.
UNION ALL: Combines result sets without removing duplicates, generally faster than UNION.
