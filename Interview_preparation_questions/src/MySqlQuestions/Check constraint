It looks like you might be referring to the CHECK constraint in MySQL. The CHECK constraint is used to ensure that all values in a column meet a specific condition.
If a row is inserted or updated that violates the CHECK constraint, the operation will be rejected.

Syntax

CREATE TABLE table_name (
    column1 datatype CHECK (condition),
    column2 datatype,
    ...
);
Example
Letâ€™s say you have a table employees where you want to ensure that the salary is always greater than 0:


CREATE TABLE employees (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    salary DECIMAL(10, 2) CHECK (salary > 0)
);
In this example:

The CHECK constraint on the salary column ensures that the value entered must be greater than 0.
Multiple CHECK Constraints
You can add multiple CHECK constraints to a table, either on different columns or the same column:


CREATE TABLE employees (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    salary DECIMAL(10, 2) CHECK (salary > 0),
    age INT CHECK (age >= 18 AND age <= 65)
);
In this example:

The salary must be greater than 0.
The age must be between 18 and 65.
Adding CHECK Constraints to Existing Tables
You can add a CHECK constraint to an existing table using the ALTER TABLE statement:


ALTER TABLE employees
ADD CHECK (salary > 0);
Limitations
MySQL Version: The CHECK constraint is supported in MySQL starting from version 8.0.16. In earlier versions, CHECK constraints are parsed but ignored.
Example with Insert

INSERT INTO employees (id, name, salary, age)
VALUES (1, 'John Doe', 5000, 30); -- This will succeed

INSERT INTO employees (id, name, salary, age)
VALUES (2, 'Jane Doe', -1000, 30); -- This will fail because salary is not greater than 0
In the second INSERT statement, the operation will be rejected because it violates the CHECK constraint on the salary column.

Summary
The CHECK constraint is used to enforce a condition on the values in a column.
It ensures data integrity by restricting the values that can be stored in a table.
This constraint can be applied when creating a new table or added to an existing table.
CHECK constraints are effective from MySQL version 8.0.16 onwards.
