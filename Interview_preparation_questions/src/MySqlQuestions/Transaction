In MySQL, transactions are used to execute a sequence of operations as a single unit of work.
 Transactions ensure that either all operations are completed successfully or none are applied, which helps maintain data integrity.

   -- Start a transaction
   START TRANSACTION;

   BEGIN
     -- // Perform some operations
     INSERT INTO accounts (account_id, balance) VALUES (1, 1000);
     UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE account_id = 1;

     --// Check for errors and commit if everything is okay
     IF @@ERROR = 0 THEN
       COMMIT; // if auto commit is enabled in mysql then dont need to commit here only rollback
     ELSE
       ROLLBACK;
     END IF;
   END;
