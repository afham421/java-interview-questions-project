‚ö°Ô∏è Answer in Short:
Native SQL queries are generally faster than JPA (JPQL) queries when fetching very large amounts of data, like millions of records.

üìä Why Native Queries Are Faster:
| Feature                | Native Query                          | JPA (JPQL) Query                         |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Execution**          | Runs directly on the DB               | Converts to SQL, adds ORM logic          |
| **Overhead**           | Minimal                               | Higher (adds mapping, tracking, caching) |
| **Control**            | Full control of joins, indexes, hints | Limited to JPA syntax                    |
| **Speed (large data)** | üî• Faster                             | üê¢ Slower due to extra processing        |


üß† Real Reason:
When you run a JPQL query, JPA:

Converts it into SQL

Maps each row to an entity object

Adds persistence context (1st-level cache)

May fetch unnecessary relationships (unless @BatchSize, fetch = FetchType.LAZY is used)

This adds memory and CPU overhead.

‚úÖ Best Practice for Huge Data Fetch:
Use Native Query for speed:


@Query(value = "SELECT * FROM large_table WHERE condition = ?", nativeQuery = true)
List<Object[]> fetchLargeData(String condition);
Use DTO projection instead of full Entity:


@Query(value = "SELECT id, name FROM large_table", nativeQuery = true)
List<MyDTO> fetchLightweightData();
Stream results if needed:


@Query("SELECT e FROM Entity e")
Stream<Entity> streamAll();
Use Pagination / Limit
Don‚Äôt load everything at once unless absolutely needed.

üö® Warning:
If you load millions of rows into memory with JPA, it may cause:

High GC activity

OutOfMemoryError

Slowness due to object mapping

üîç Conclusion:
For small/medium data: JPA is fine

For millions of records: Native query + lightweight DTO or streaming is best
