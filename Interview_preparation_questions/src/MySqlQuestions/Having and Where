In SQL, HAVING and WHERE are both used to filter records, but they serve different purposes.
we can use the both in one query

WHERE:
Filters rows before any grouping takes place.
Used with individual rows.

SELECT column1, column2
FROM table
WHERE condition;

HAVING:
Filters rows after the GROUP BY clause.
Used to filter grouped rows (aggregated data).

SELECT column1, COUNT(*)
FROM table
GROUP BY column1
HAVING condition;
Example:
To filter by age before grouping:


SELECT name, COUNT(*)
FROM users
WHERE age > 30
GROUP BY name;
To filter by grouped data:


SELECT name, COUNT(*)
FROM users
GROUP BY name
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;

In summary, use WHERE to filter rows before grouping and HAVING to filter after aggregation.
