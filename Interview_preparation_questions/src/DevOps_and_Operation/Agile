‚úÖ What is Agile?
Agile is a software development approach that focuses on collaboration, customer feedback, rapid delivery, and continuous improvement.
 It breaks down projects into small, manageable iterations (often called sprints) to deliver value quickly and adapt to changing requirements.

üéØ Core Principles of Agile (from the Agile Manifesto)
Customer satisfaction through early and continuous delivery

Welcome changing requirements, even late in development

Deliver working software frequently (e.g., every 2 weeks)

Collaboration between business stakeholders and developers

Build projects around motivated individuals

Face-to-face conversation is the best form of communication

Working software is the primary measure of progress

Sustainable development, maintaining a constant pace

Continuous attention to technical excellence

Simplicity‚Äîthe art of maximizing work not done

Self-organizing teams produce better architectures and designs

Regular reflection and adjustments for better efficiency

| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| **Scrum**                    | Work in sprints (1‚Äì4 weeks), defined roles (Scrum Master, Product Owner), regular meetings | Product development teams        |
| **Kanban**                   | Visualize work on a board, limit work-in-progress, optimize flow                           | Maintenance, support teams       |
| **Extreme Programming (XP)** | Emphasizes technical practices (TDD, pair programming, refactoring)                        | High-quality, fast-paced dev     |
| **Lean**                     | Eliminate waste, deliver value faster                                                      | Process improvement              |
| **SAFe (Scaled Agile)**      | Agile at enterprise level, used in large organizations                                     | Scaling Agile across departments |

‚úÖ Scrum (most relevant to you)
Since you mentioned Agile (Scrum) in your skills, here‚Äôs a quick recap:

Sprint-based work (usually 2 weeks)

Involves ceremonies: Sprint Planning, Daily Standups, Sprint Review, Sprint Retrospective

Clearly defined roles: Product Owner, Scrum Master, and Development Team

Works best for Java development teams building software with clear goals and deadlines (like your work on B-SMS and OBD systems)


üë• Key Roles in Agile
Product Owner: Defines features, prioritizes backlog, represents customer

Scrum Master: Facilitates meetings, removes blockers, ensures Agile practices

Development Team: Cross-functional developers, testers, designers, etc.

üß™ Ceremonies in Scrum (Popular Agile Method)
Sprint Planning: Plan what will be delivered in the upcoming sprint

Daily Stand-up: 15-minute status update meeting

Sprint Review: Demonstrate completed work to stakeholders

Sprint Retrospective: Reflect on what went well or could be improved

üõ†Ô∏è Agile in Practice (for Java Developers)
As a Java developer, you use Agile when:

You work in sprints and deliver modules in iterations

You participate in daily standups

You manage tasks in Jira or Trello

You develop REST APIs, microservices, etc., in small deliverables

You use tools like Jenkins, Git, Docker, Kubernetes in CI/CD pipelines to support Agile delivery

‚úçÔ∏è Sample Interview Answer
"I work in an Agile environment following Scrum methodology. We operate in 2-week sprints with regular sprint planning, daily stand-ups, and retrospectives.
 As a Java developer, I deliver backend features, participate in backlog grooming, and collaborate closely with QA and product teams.
 This allows us to ship high-quality code quickly and adapt to client feedback efficiently."
