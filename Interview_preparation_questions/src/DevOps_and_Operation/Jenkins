🔧 What is Jenkins?
Jenkins is an open-source automation server used to:

Automate building, testing, and deploying code

Implement CI/CD pipelines

Integrate with tools like Git, Docker, Maven, Gradle, Kubernetes, etc.

🚀 Why Jenkins?
Saves time by automating repetitive tasks

Ensures code is tested and deployed continuously

Helps catch bugs early

Works well with many languages and tools

🛠️ How Jenkins Works
Developers push code to a version control system (e.g., GitHub).

Jenkins detects changes (via webhook or polling).

Builds the project using tools like Maven/Gradle.

Runs tests (unit tests, integration tests).

If all passes:

Deploys the app (e.g., to Docker, a server, or Kubernetes).

📦 Jenkins Pipeline (Example)
groovy
Copy
Edit
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                sh 'mvn clean package'
            }
        }
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                sh 'mvn test'
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                sh 'docker build -t myapp .'
                sh 'docker run -d -p 8080:8080 myapp'
            }
        }
    }
}
