In Java (and OOP in general), relationships between classes define how classes interact with or depend on each other. These relationships help model real-world systems.

🧩 Types of Class Relationships in Java
1. Association – “has-a”
A general relationship between two classes.

Example: A Teacher has a Student.


class Teacher {
    Student student; // Association
    // means teacher has student or teacher has id,name etc
}

******************   association has two types (aggregation ,  composition)

2. Aggregation – “has-a” (weak ownership)
Special form of Association.

One class can exist independently of the other.

Example: A Team has Players, but Players can exist without the Team.


class Player { }

class Team {
    List<Player> players; // Aggregation
}
🔸 Represented by a hollow diamond in UML.



3. Composition – “has-a” (strong ownership)
Stronger form of Aggregation.

One class cannot exist without the other.

Example: A House has Rooms, and if the House is destroyed, Rooms are too.


class Room { }

class House {
    private Room room = new Room(); // Composition                   ////because of private it cannot be access outside the class
}
🔸 Represented by a filled diamond in UML.

4. Inheritance – “is-a”
One class inherits from another.

Promotes reusability.

Example: A Dog is a Animal.


class Animal { }

class Dog extends Animal { } // Inheritance
🔸 Represented by a hollow triangle arrow in UML.



5. Dependency – “uses”
One class uses another class temporarily (local variable, method param).

Example: A CarService class uses Engine class in a method.


class Engine { }

class CarService {
    void repair(Engine engine) { } // Dependency
}
🔸 Represented by a dashed arrow in UML.

🔁 Summary Table
| Relationship | Type       | Lifetime Dependency | UML Symbol      | Example                 |
| ------------ | ---------- | ------------------- | --------------- | ----------------------- |
| Association  | Structural | Independent         | Straight line   | `Student` – `Teacher`   |
| Aggregation  | Structural | Weak (shared)       | Hollow diamond  | `Team` – `Player`       |
| Composition  | Structural | Strong (owns)       | Filled diamond  | `House` – `Room`        |
| Inheritance  | Structural | "is-a" hierarchy    | Hollow triangle | `Dog` – `Animal`        |
| Dependency   | Behavioral | Temporary use       | Dashed arrow    | `CarService` – `Engine` |



🧩 UML Diagram Example – Class Relationships
Let’s say we’re modeling a Library System. Here’s how different relationships look:

🏛️ Classes:
Library

Book

Author

Member

Address

✅ UML Relationships:

[Library] ◼───[Book]          → Composition (Library *owns* books)

[Book] ◇───[Author]           → Aggregation (Author *can exist* without book)

[Library] ─── [Address]       → Association (Library *has* Address)

[Member] ──uses──▶ [Book]     → Dependency (Member *borrows* Book temporarily)

[Member] ⬆──── [Person]       → Inheritance (Member *is a* Person)
Legend:

◼ Filled diamond = Composition

◇ Hollow diamond = Aggregation

─── = Association

──uses──▶ = Dependency

⬆ = Inheritance
