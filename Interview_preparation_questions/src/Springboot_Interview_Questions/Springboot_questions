Spring Boot is a framework that simplifies the development of Java-based, enterprise-level applications by providing a streamlined, opinionated approach to configuration and setup.
It is built on top of the Spring Framework, which is a widely used framework for building Java applications, particularly web applications.

        1. Simplified Configuration:
Spring Framework: In traditional Spring, you have to manually configure many aspects of your application, such as beans, database connections, and security settings.
This often involves writing extensive XML configurations or Java-based configuration classes.
Spring Boot: Spring Boot simplifies configuration by using autoconfiguration. It intelligently guesses and configures your application based on the libraries on your classpath,
so you get up and running faster with less manual setup.
        2. Opinionated Defaults:
Spring Framework: While powerful, the Spring Framework requires developers to make many decisions about how to structure their applications, which libraries to include,
and how to configure them.
Spring Boot: Spring Boot provides opinionated defaults for typical use cases, which means many decisions are made for you, based on best practices.
This leads to faster development since you don't need to configure everything from scratch.
        3. Embedded Servers:
Spring Framework: With traditional Spring, you typically need to deploy your application to an external server like Apache Tomcat or Jetty.
Spring Boot: Spring Boot allows you to create standalone applications by embedding servers directly into the application. This means your application can be packaged as
a simple JAR file with an embedded server (like Tomcat), and run with a single command. This simplifies deployment and makes it easier to create self-contained microservices.
        4. Rapid Development:
Spring Framework: While Spring provides a lot of flexibility, this often comes at the cost of initial setup time.
Getting a new project up and running can take longer due to the need to manually configure components.
Spring Boot: Spring Boot is designed for rapid development. With tools like Spring Initializr and Spring Boot Starters(Starters are pre-configured dependency packages
that include everything you need for a particular feature (e.g., web development, security). ),you can quickly scaffold a new project with all the necessary
dependencies and configurations, allowing you to focus more on writing business logic.
        5. Microservices Support:
Spring Framework: While traditional Spring can be used to build microservices,
it doesn't provide the out-of-the-box tools and features that are often needed for microservice architecture.
Spring Boot: Spring Boot is ideal for building microservices due to its lightweight nature and embedded server capabilities. It integrates seamlessly with Spring Cloud,
which provides features like service discovery, configuration management, and circuit breakers, making it easier to build robust microservices.
        6. Production-Ready Features:
Spring Framework: While you can configure traditional Spring applications for production, it requires more manual effort to set up things like monitoring, health checks, and metrics.
Spring Boot: Spring Boot includes many production-ready features out of the box, such as health checks, metrics, and application monitoring via Spring Boot Actuator.
These features make it easier to manage and monitor your application in a production environment.
        7. Community and Ecosystem:
Spring Framework: Spring has a large and active community, but traditional Spring applications can sometimes be more challenging to set up and configure, especially for new developers.
Spring Boot: Spring Boot has quickly become the de facto standard for new Spring projects, with a large and growing community. The ecosystem around Spring Boot,
        including tutorials, documentation, and third-party tools, is robust and continuously expanding.
        8. Testability:
Spring Framework: Testing Spring applications is possible but often requires more setup, such as loading specific configurations for different environments.
Spring Boot: Spring Boot provides testing support out of the box with tools like SpringBootTest, which simplifies writing and running integration tests.
It also offers embedded databases for quick setup of test environments.
        9. Spring Boot CLI:
Spring Boot: The Spring Boot CLI allows for rapid prototyping and running of Groovy scripts, which can be especially useful for testing out ideas or
creating small utilities quickly. This is not something offered by the traditional Spring Framework.
        Conclusion:
Spring Boot is often chosen over the traditional Spring Framework because it significantly reduces the complexity and time required to set up and configure applications.
It provides a more streamlined, opinionated approach, making it easier to create production-ready applications quickly. This makes it particularly well-suited for building modern,
cloud-native, and microservice-based applications, where speed of development and deployment are critical.I: Allows rapid prototyping with Groovy scripts,
useful for testing and utilities.
