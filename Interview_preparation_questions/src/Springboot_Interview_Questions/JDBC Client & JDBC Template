JDBC Client and Spring's JdbcTemplate are both used to interact with relational databases in Java,
 but they differ significantly in terms of implementation and ease of use.

1. JDBC Client (Core JDBC) // it come in spring aop 6.1 and the springboot version that contains spring aop 6.1
JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) is the standard Java API for connecting and interacting with databases.
 It involves writing boilerplate code to manage database connections, execute SQL queries, handle result sets,
  and close resources (like connections, prepared statements, and result sets).

Key Points of JDBC Client:
Manual Resource Management: You need to explicitly open and close connections, statements, and result sets.
Chain methods: in springboot we can use method chaining in client jdbcClient.sql(query).param(param1).param(param2).update();
More Boilerplate Code: Every interaction with the database requires repetitive code (e.g., connection setup, resource cleanup).
Exception Handling: You need to handle SQL exceptions in detail.
Flexibility: Core JDBC gives more control over how you interact with the database.

Example:
import java.sql.Connection;
import java.sql.DriverManager;
import java.sql.PreparedStatement;
import java.sql.ResultSet;
import java.sql.SQLException;

public class JdbcClientExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String url = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydb";
        String user = "username";
        String password = "password";

        Connection conn = null;
        PreparedStatement stmt = null;
        ResultSet rs = null;

        try {
            conn = DriverManager.getConnection(url, user, password);
            String sql = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?";
            stmt = conn.prepareStatement(sql);
            stmt.setInt(1, 1);
            rs = stmt.executeQuery();

            while (rs.next()) {
                System.out.println(rs.getString("name"));
            }
        } catch (SQLException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        } finally {
            try {
                if (rs != null) rs.close();
                if (stmt != null) stmt.close();
                if (conn != null) conn.close();
            } catch (SQLException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        }
    }
}
2. Spring's JdbcTemplate
JdbcTemplate is part of the Spring Framework and abstracts away much of the boilerplate code associated with JDBC.
It simplifies database access by handling resource management, exception translation, and the common SQL operations like querying, inserting, and updating.

Key Points of JdbcTemplate:
Automatic Resource Management: Handles opening and closing of connections, statements, and result sets automatically.
Less Boilerplate: Reduces the amount of repetitive code. You don’t have to worry about explicitly closing resources.
Exception Handling: Spring’s JdbcTemplate translates SQLException into unchecked, runtime exceptions (like DataAccessException).
Predefined Query Methods: Provides various helper methods for common database operations like queryForObject, update, etc.
Integration: Works well with Spring’s dependency injection and other Spring components.

Example:
import org.springframework.jdbc.core.JdbcTemplate;
import org.springframework.jdbc.datasource.DriverManagerDataSource;

public class JdbcTemplateExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        DriverManagerDataSource dataSource = new DriverManagerDataSource();
        dataSource.setUrl("jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydb");
        dataSource.setUsername("username");
        dataSource.setPassword("password");

        JdbcTemplate jdbcTemplate = new JdbcTemplate(dataSource);

        String sql = "SELECT name FROM users WHERE id = ?";
        String name = jdbcTemplate.queryForObject(sql, new Object[]{1}, String.class);

        System.out.println(name);
    }
}
Key Differences:
Aspect	                                JDBC Client	                                                                                    Spring JdbcTemplate
Boilerplate Code            	Requires significant boilerplate code for managing connections, statements, and result sets.        	Reduces boilerplate code by handling resource management automatically.
Resource Management	            Manual (connections, statements, result sets must be explicitly closed).    	    Automatic (handled internally by Spring).
Error Handling          	SQLExceptions must be handled explicitly.	     Translates checked SQLException into Spring's DataAccessException (unchecked).
Flexibility         	Provides fine-grained control, but at the cost of more complexity.      	Simplifies common operations but abstracts away lower-level details.
Integration         	Independent of any framework; requires manual management of transactions and configuration.     	    Integrated with Spring’s ecosystem (dependency injection, transactions, etc.).
Learning Curve          	Requires understanding of core JDBC.	            Easier to use, especially within a Spring application.

When to Use:
JDBC Client: If you want full control over the database interactions and are working on a simple project or want to minimize dependencies,
 core JDBC can be a good choice. It gives you flexibility but at the cost of writing more code.

Spring JdbcTemplate: If you're working with the Spring framework, JdbcTemplate is the go-to solution for interacting with databases.
 It streamlines code, reduces boilerplate, and integrates well with other Spring components like transaction management.

Both JDBC and JdbcTemplate are useful tools, but JdbcTemplate is more convenient and efficient for database operations,
especially when building Spring-based applications.
