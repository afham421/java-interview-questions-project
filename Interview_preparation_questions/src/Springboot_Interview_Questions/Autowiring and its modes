Autowiring in Spring Framework is a feature used to automatically inject bean dependencies without explicitly specifying them.
It reduces the need for @Autowired or setters in the configuration by matching and injecting beans based on certain criteria.

Autowiring Modes:
no (default):
No autowiring is done, and you need to define all dependencies manually.

byType:
Autowires the bean by matching the data type of a property with the type of a bean. If exactly one bean of that type is found, it is autowired.it use setter method

byName:
Autowires the bean by matching the name of a property with a bean's name in the configuration.it use setter method

constructor:
Autowires the bean using its constructor. It matches the constructor parameter types with available beans.

autodetect (Deprecated):
Spring first tries constructor autowiring; if it doesn't work, it falls back to byType.
