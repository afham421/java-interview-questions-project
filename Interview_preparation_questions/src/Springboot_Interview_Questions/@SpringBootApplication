In Spring Boot, the @SpringBootApplication annotation is a key part of bootstrapping a Spring Boot application.
It is used to mark the main class of a Spring Boot application and combines three important annotations:

Breakdown of @SpringBootApplication
The @SpringBootApplication annotation is a composite of the following annotations:

@Configuration:

Indicates that the class provides Spring configuration. It tells Spring that this class can define beans using methods annotated with @Bean.

@EnableAutoConfiguration:
Enables Spring Boot's auto-configuration feature. It automatically configures Spring application based on the dependencies present in the classpath.
For example, if you have spring-boot-starter-web in your project, Spring Boot will automatically configure the web server and related components.

@ComponentScan:
Enables component scanning. It tells Spring to scan the package where the main class is located (and its sub-packages) for Spring components
 like @Controller, @Service, @Repository, and any beans annotated with @Component.
