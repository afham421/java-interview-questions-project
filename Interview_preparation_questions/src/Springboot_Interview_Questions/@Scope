In Spring, scopes define the lifecycle and visibility of beans within the Spring container.
By default, Spring beans are singleton, meaning there's only one instance of the bean per Spring IoC container.


Singleton: One instance per Spring IoC container (default).
Prototype: A new instance for every request.
Request: One instance per HTTP request (web application).
Session: One instance per HTTP session (web application).
Application: One instance per ServletContext (web application).
WebSocket: One instance per WebSocket session (web application).

Singleton (@Scope("singleton")): Only one instance of the bean is created for the entire application context. This is the default scope.
Prototype (@Scope("prototype")): A new instance of the bean is created each time it is requested.
Request (@Scope("request")): A new instance is created for each HTTP request. Typically used in web applications.
Session (@Scope("session")): A new instance is created for each HTTP session. Used in web applications.
Application (@Scope("application")): A single instance is created for the entire lifecycle of a ServletContext.
WebSocket (@Scope("websocket")): A single instance is created for the lifecycle of a WebSocket.
