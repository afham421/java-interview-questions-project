    @Inject and @Autowired are both used for dependency injection in Spring, but they come from different frameworks and have subtle differences.
    @Autowired:
    Origin: It is specific to the Spring Framework.
    Standard: It is a Spring-specific annotation.

    @Inject:
    Origin: It comes from the Java Dependency Injection (JSR-330) standard.
    Standard: It is a part of the javax.inject package, which is a standard for dependency injection in Java.

    Usage and Compatibility
    @Autowired:
    Spring Specific: It’s tightly coupled with Spring’s dependency injection container and works seamlessly within the Spring ecosystem.
    Legacy: It’s more commonly used in older Spring applications but remains widely used due to its flexibility and features.
    @Inject:
    Framework Agnostic: Since it’s part of a standard, it can be used in any framework that supports JSR-330, making it more portable across different DI frameworks.
    Modern Applications: It’s more commonly used in modern Java applications that prefer using standard annotations for better portability and framework independence.

@Component
public class MyService {

    @Autowired
    private MyRepository myRepository;

     or constructor injection
    @Autowired
    public MyService(MyRepository myRepository) {
        this.myRepository = myRepository;
    }
}


@Component
public class MyService {

    @Inject
    private MyRepository myRepository;

     or constructor injection
    @Inject
    public MyService(MyRepository myRepository) {
        this.myRepository = myRepository;
    }

     using @Named instead of @Qualifier
    @Inject
    @Named("myCustomRepository")
    private MyRepository myCustomRepository;
}

Use @Autowired if you are working in a purely Spring-based application and want to leverage Spring-specific features.
Use @Inject if you prefer to follow Java standards (JSR-330) and aim for portability across different DI frameworks.
