In Spring, @Bean and @Component are both used for defining and managing beans within the Spring container, but they serve different purposes and are used in different contexts.

1. @Component
Purpose: @Component is a class-level annotation used to automatically detect and register a class as a Spring bean. It marks the class as a candidate for component scanning,
meaning Spring will automatically discover and create an instance of the class as a bean during the component scan process.
Use Case: It's typically used for general-purpose components (services, repositories, controllers, etc.) that you want Spring to manage automatically.
Automatic Detection: When you use @Component, Spring will automatically scan and register the class as a bean without the need to explicitly declare it in a configuration file.

Subtypes: There are specialized stereotypes derived from @Component:
@Service - Used to define service-layer components.
@Repository - Used for DAO (Data Access Object) components.
@Controller - Used for Spring MVC controllers.

2. @Bean  // @Configuration is must on class where Been is created // by @bean we can set custom configuration
Purpose: @Bean is a method-level annotation used within a Spring configuration class (a class annotated with @Configuration).
It explicitly declares a bean, meaning that Spring will invoke the method and manage the returned object as a Spring bean.
Use Case: It's used when you want to manually control the instantiation and configuration of a bean, often when you need to set up complex initialization logic,
 or when the bean is provided by a third-party library that you don't want to annotate with Spring-specific annotations.
Explicit Definition: Unlike @Component, @Bean requires you to explicitly define the bean in a configuration class.
Fine-Grained Control: @Bean gives you full control over the creation and configuration of the bean, allowing you to call constructors, set properties,
 or inject dependencies as needed.

3. Key Differences
Level of Abstraction:

@Component is more abstract, focusing on high-level component registration through class-level annotations.
@Bean is more concrete, focusing on method-level bean registration and giving you control over the bean creation process.

Discovery vs. Explicit Declaration:
@Component is discovered automatically through classpath scanning.
@Bean is explicitly declared within a @Configuration class.

Use Context:
@Component is best for standard Spring components where automatic scanning and registration are sufficient.
@Bean is ideal when you need more control over the bean's lifecycle or when integrating non-Spring components into the Spring context.

4. When to Use Which?
Use @Component:
When you want Spring to automatically detect and manage your bean.
When your class is a typical Spring-managed component, like a service, repository, or controller.
When you prefer annotation-based configuration over XML or Java-based configuration.
Use @Bean:
When you need to control the creation of the bean, such as passing parameters, setting properties, or invoking a constructor with custom logic.
When you are configuring third-party classes that are not annotated with Spring-specific annotations.
When you want to conditionally create a bean based on some logic in the @Configuration class.
