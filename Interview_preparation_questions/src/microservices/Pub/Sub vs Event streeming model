📣 1. Pub/Sub (Publish-Subscribe)
🔍 What It Is:
Pub/Sub is a messaging pattern where producers (publishers) send messages (events), and consumers (subscribers) receive them through a message broker.

🔁 Core Characteristics:
Decoupled: Publishers and subscribers don’t know about each other.

One-to-many: One event can be received by multiple subscribers.

Message is transient: If a subscriber is offline, it may miss the event (unless the system supports durable subscriptions).

🔧 Tools That Support Pub/Sub:
Google Cloud Pub/Sub

Amazon SNS

RabbitMQ (fanout exchange)

Kafka (as a pattern)

📦 Example:
A UserService publishes a UserRegistered event:

EmailService subscribes to send welcome emails.

AnalyticsService subscribes to log user behavior.

🔄 2. Event Streaming
🔍 What It Is:
Event streaming means continuous flow of events that are recorded, stored, and can be replayed. It's used not only for messaging, but also for event-driven processing, storage, and analytics.

🔁 Core Characteristics:
Durable: Events are stored on disk and can be replayed.

Ordered: Events are typically ordered by topic/partition.

Replayable: Consumers can reprocess past events.

Scalable: Can handle high-throughput, real-time data streams.

🔧 Tools That Support Event Streaming:
Apache Kafka ✅ (most popular)

Apache Pulsar

Amazon Kinesis

Redpanda

📦 Example:
ClickStreamService streams millions of web clicks into Kafka.

FraudDetectionService consumes the stream in real-time.

DataLakeIngestor also consumes the same stream to store it in S3 for analytics.
