üåê Spring MVC (Model-View-Controller)
‚úÖ What is it?
Spring MVC is the traditional, blocking, and servlet-based web framework in Spring. It's built on the Servlet API and uses synchronous (blocking) I/O.

üîß Key Features
Blocking architecture: One thread per request.

Thread is blocked while waiting for the response (e.g., database, network).

Suitable for traditional web apps or REST APIs where load is moderate.

üß± Tech Stack
Based on Servlet containers like Tomcat or Jetty.

Uses DispatcherServlet as the entry point.

Annotated controllers using @RestController, @GetMapping, etc.

java
Copy
Edit
@RestController
public class HelloController {

    @GetMapping("/hello")
    public String hello() {
        return "Hello, MVC!";
    }
}
‚ö° Spring WebFlux
‚úÖ What is it?
Spring WebFlux is the non-blocking, reactive web framework introduced in Spring 5. It's designed for high concurrency and real-time apps, and can run on Netty, Undertow, or traditional servlet containers.

üîß Key Features
Non-blocking architecture: Uses Reactive Streams.

Efficient under high-load / async systems.

Built on Project Reactor (Flux & Mono types).

Handles backpressure well.

üß± Tech Stack
Can run on Netty (default) or traditional servlet containers.

Uses WebHandler, not DispatcherServlet.

Controller methods return Mono<T> (single item) or Flux<T> (stream of items).

java
Copy
Edit
@RestController
public class HelloReactiveController {

    @GetMapping("/hello")
    public Mono<String> hello() {
        return Mono.just("Hello, WebFlux!");
    }
}
üîç MVC vs WebFlux: Head-to-Head
| Feature        | Spring MVC                  | Spring WebFlux                       |
| -------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Type           | Blocking                    | Non-blocking (Reactive)              |
| Uses           | Servlet API                 | Reactive Streams (Reactor)           |
| Performance    | Good for typical workloads  | Better for high concurrency          |
| Return types   | `String`, `ResponseEntity`  | `Mono<T>`, `Flux<T>`                 |
| Thread model   | One request = one thread    | Event-loop (fewer threads)           |
| Default server | Tomcat                      | Netty                                |
| Suitable for   | CRUD APIs, classic web apps | Streaming, chat apps, microservices  |
| Learning curve | Easier                      | Steeper (requires reactive thinking) |

üß† When to Use What?
Use Spring MVC if:

Your app is I/O-light (CPU-bound, like normal APIs).

You're integrating with blocking libraries (JPA, JDBC).

You want simplicity and wide ecosystem support.

Use Spring WebFlux if:

Your app is I/O-heavy (chat apps, streaming, websockets).

You want better scalability under load.

You‚Äôre using non-blocking DBs (like R2DBC, Mongo Reactive).
