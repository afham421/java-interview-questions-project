üß© When to Use What?
‚úÖ Use RabbitMQ when:
You need message reliability in task queues (like OBD calls, OTP sending, SMS delivery).

You want flexible routing using exchanges (direct, topic, fanout).

Your system expects low to medium throughput and real-time delivery.

You need quick retries and DLQ (Dead Letter Queues) out of the box.

üí° In your OBD call functionality or SMS system, RabbitMQ is often ideal for job distribution, like calling thousands of users one by one.

‚úÖ Use Kafka when:
You are building a high-throughput system (e.g., telemetry, logs, real-time analytics).

You need message persistence, stream replay, or event sourcing.

You want to scale horizontally with consumer groups.

You're handling large volumes of immutable events over time.

üí° If you're tracking user interactions across services (like a user clicked a link from an SMS, or completed a survey after a call), Kafka would help collect and stream those events into databases, analytics systems, or Elasticsearch.

üì¶ Integration in Spring Boot

2. Interview-style Answers
Q: What are the main differences between RabbitMQ and Kafka?

RabbitMQ is a message broker designed for reliable message delivery with complex routing via exchanges and supports different messaging patterns like pub/sub and task queues. It is push-based and best for real-time, short-lived messages such as OTP or job dispatch.

Kafka is a distributed event streaming platform that stores streams of records in durable logs. It is pull-based and designed for high-throughput, event sourcing, and big data pipelines. Kafka is ideal for replaying events, streaming analytics, and systems needing horizontal scaling.

Q: When would you choose RabbitMQ over Kafka?

I would choose RabbitMQ when I need guaranteed message delivery with flexible routing, support for dead-letter queues, and when the message volume is moderate, such as sending OTP codes, SMS notifications, or handling asynchronous tasks in a microservice. RabbitMQ‚Äôs simpler setup also makes it ideal for quick implementations.

Q: Can you describe how you‚Äôve used RabbitMQ or Kafka in your projects?

In my previous project, I used RabbitMQ to manage the distribution of outbound dialing jobs (OBD calls) where reliability and quick retries were critical. RabbitMQ‚Äôs features like dead-letter queues helped handle failed calls gracefully.

For event streaming and logging, I used Kafka to capture real-time user actions and system events, enabling downstream analytics and auditing services to process data asynchronously and at scale.

3. Resume / LinkedIn Experience Points
Implemented RabbitMQ for asynchronous task handling and outbound dialing job distribution, improving system reliability and fault tolerance.

Developed and maintained Kafka-based event streaming pipelines for real-time analytics and audit logging, ensuring high throughput and scalable data processing.

Integrated Spring Boot applications with RabbitMQ and Kafka using spring-boot-starter-amqp and spring-kafka, respectively, facilitating robust messaging and event-driven microservices.

Designed message-driven microservices with reliable message delivery, dead-letter queue handling, and horizontal scalability.

Collaborated in Agile teams to deploy CI/CD pipelines with Docker and Kubernetes for containerized messaging services.
