Yes, exactly! The -d flag in Docker stands for "detached mode."

🧾 What is -d in Docker?
When you run a container using:

bash
Copy
Edit
docker run -d <image-name>
It tells Docker to run the container in the background (detached from your terminal), allowing you to continue using the terminal for other tasks.

🆚 Without -d (Foreground mode):
bash
Copy
Edit
docker run <image-name>
Docker runs the container in the foreground.

You see logs/output directly in your terminal.

You can’t type other commands until you stop it (usually with Ctrl + C).

✅ Use -d when:
You want the container to keep running in the background.

You’re running web servers, databases, or long-lived applications.

You don’t need to see real-time logs immediately.

🛠 Example:
bash
Copy
Edit
docker run -d --name spring-app -p 8080:8080 my-spring-image
This will:

Run my-spring-image in background

Map container's port 8080 to your local port 8080

Name the container spring-app

🔍 To view logs later:
bash
Copy
Edit
docker logs spring-app
