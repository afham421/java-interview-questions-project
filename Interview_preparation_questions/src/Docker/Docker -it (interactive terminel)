🔤 -it in Docker stands for:
-i = interactive → Keeps STDIN (standard input) open so you can type into the container

-t = terminal → Allocates a pseudo-TTY (a terminal session)

Together, -it allows you to interact with the container through your terminal — like a command-line interface.

✅ In simple terms:
-it = Interactive Terminal

Yes — you can think of it as enabling input (keyboard) and output (terminal).

📦 Example:

docker run -it ubuntu
This command:

Starts a container from the ubuntu image

Gives you a shell inside the container

You can now type commands like ls, cd, apt update, etc.

🔁 Difference from -d:
| Flag  | Mode        | Description                         |
| ----- | ----------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `-it` | Interactive | For manual command-line interaction |
| `-d`  | Detached    | Runs in the background              |


You can also combine both when needed:


docker run -it -d ubuntu
But in most cases, -it is for debugging or exploring a container interactively.
