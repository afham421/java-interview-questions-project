ðŸš¢ Docker Image
A Docker image is a blueprint or template used to create Docker containers. It contains:

The application code

Libraries

Dependencies

Configuration files

Environment settings

It's read-only and used to build containers.

ðŸ§  Think of it like a class in Java â€” it defines what the container will be, but it doesn't "run" by itself.

Example:
An image might contain:

Ubuntu OS

Java 21

Your Spring Boot app .jar file

You build or pull it using:


docker build -t myapp-image .
or


docker pull openjdk:21
ðŸ“¦ Docker Container
A Docker container is a running instance of a Docker image. It:

Runs in an isolated environment

Is lightweight and portable

Can be started, stopped, or deleted

ðŸ§  Think of it like an object in Java â€” itâ€™s a running, live thing created from the image.

Run a container from an image:

docker run -d --name myapp-container myapp-image
